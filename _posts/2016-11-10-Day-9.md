#Things that I did today
1. Didn't do well in my "Algorithemic Aspects of Communications". 
2. **First day of Internship** Loved it. People were so nice. Talked about real-time object detection (YOLO, SSD), deep learning, TensorFlow, Adobe and what not. Currently I am studying about YOLO. Cannot wait for tomorrow.


_9:50:05 PM Having a great feeling because of the internship. Exhausted but satisfied._
