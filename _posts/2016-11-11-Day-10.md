#Things that I did today

    1. 2nd day of Internship. Again, it was amazing. Had so fun after knowing so many new things. Had a great talk about Augmented reality with my team leader. I am loving this whole experience. And, I am learning so much. I just don't want this to end.
  
    2.After finishing the theis on YOLO, I went on doing the tesing some sample images. It works well. Though I find some objects which YOLO couldn't detect, but then those objects were really hard to figure out, even for me. 


_9:28:03 PM: Going home after a farwell party for an Exchange Student. Hope to see him again._
