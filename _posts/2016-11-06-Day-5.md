# Things I did today
1. Competed at Google Code Jam APAC 2017. I did really bad and was able to solve only problem A. I got to partially correct solution for problem B. Just ran out of time to correct the fault. :disappointed:.I am really worried :worried: about my performance. 
2. Finished Project Euler Problem 16
3. Worked on my resume. 19 days left to send the resume for Google. 
4. Wrote my report for "Mathematical Semantics of Computer Systems".

_I wanna write more about my solutions for Code Jam. But with the feeling of disappointment from the contest and the year's worst cough that I have today, I might write about it later._
