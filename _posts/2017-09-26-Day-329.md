#Things that I did today
1. Got an official leave from University. With the mental state that I am in, it is just impossible to focus on my Research. I just want to slow down things. My skills to finish my research are still below average. I am going to spend my leave to improve it. 
2. No more time to waste. 
3. Things fast, and take action even faster. 
4. It's going to be a recap for all the studies that I have done till now. 
5. Filling my application for an internship at Google US branch one day before the deadline. Chances are really slim. 
My Time Starts Now........
