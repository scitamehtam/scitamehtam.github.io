#Things that I did today
1. **Disappointed about my performance in the Google interview**
I could have done much better. What happens to me during interviews? Failed again!
2. **Started Doing HackerRank after a long time**
Got the Algorithm batch after solving a graph theory. Felt little happy. 
3. **Research Work** 
Trying to finish a program to print the certificates of non-terminals elements of configuration tree. Donno if I can finish within 10 hours.
4. **Mental Frustration**
Somedays ago, I read about the [Quietest room](http://www.businessinsider.com/inside-microsoft-quietest-room-in-the-world-2016-8) created by Microsoft. Wish I can be there for few minutes every day. 
People are noisy. I want silence in my life.
