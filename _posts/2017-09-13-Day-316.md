#Things that I did today
1. **InterviewBit**: Solved three problems in Arrays section. Either I am becoming more stupid or I was always like this. Doing so many silly mistakes. 
2. Confused about so many things. Had to block all the SNS sites. Cannot concentrate on anything. Just wanna print some programming questions, go to a silent place and solve all of them without thinking about the rest of the things going in my life. 
3. Kill me! *Some happy people make me soooooooooooooooooooooooo sad*.
